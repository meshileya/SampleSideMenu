# SampleSideMenu

Navigating through an application actually caught my attention and I intend replicating same experience.

In the cause of my research, I was able to get SideMenu library, although it was a little bit challenging for me to understand the documentation for implementing without having to use Storyboard so I had to just come up with something simple for me.

###Tools Used
1. https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu
2. Xcode

NOTE: If you are using just pure code without storyboard, you should be able to implement this without any form of issue/challenge in your project and for those using Storyboard, you can as well check out the repo to see how the implementation is.

Check the experience out.
